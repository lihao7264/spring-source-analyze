/**
 * Extension of the {@link BeanFactory} interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement
 * this interface.
 *
 * <p>If this is a {@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}, the return values will <i>not</i>
 * take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans
 * defined in the current factory. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils} helper class
 * to consider beans in ancestor factories too.
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesOfType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
 *
 * 它可以提供Bean的迭代。
 *
 *    它是 BeanFactory 接口的扩展，它可以实现枚举其所有bean实例，而不是按客户的要求按名称一一尝试进行bean查找。
 * 预加载其所有bean定义的 BeanFactory 实现（例如，基于XML的工厂）可以实现此接口。
 *    如果实现类同时也实现了 HierarchicalBeanFactory，返回值也不会考虑任何 BeanFactory 层次结构，而仅与当前工厂中定义的bean有关。
 *  但可以使用 BeanFactoryUtils 工具类来获取父工厂中的bean。
 *    该接口中的方法将仅遵守该工厂的bean定义。
 *  它们将忽略通过其它方式（例如 ConfigurableBeanFactory 的 registerSingleton 方法）注册的任何单例bean，
 *  但 getBeanNamesOfType 和 getBeansOfType 除外，它们也将检查此类手动注册的单例。
 *  当然，BeanFactory 的getBean 确实也允许透明访问此类特殊bean。
 *  但是，在典型情况下，无论如何，所有bean都将由外部bean定义来定义，因此大多数应用程序不必担心这种区别。
 *
 * 总结：ListableBeanFactory它可以提供Bean的迭代。
